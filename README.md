# CryptoClustering Challenge

# Task
Use background knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

# Background
The provided dataset revealed that a small handful of microbial species also called Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU's) in the study
were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

# Data Engineering: Libraries and Dependencies
  1. Python
  2. hvplot
  3. sklearn.cluster: KMeans
  4. sklearn.decomposition: PCA
  5. sklearn.preprocessing: StandardScaler
  6. Visual Studio Code

# Data Analysis
1. Elbow Curve 1 yieled cluster 4 to be the best value for k in original data set.
2. Elbow Curve 2 yieled cluster 4 to be the best value for k in the PCA data set.
2. The total explained variance of the three principal components is: 0.8950316570309841
3. No k value delta exist between PCA and the original data set.
